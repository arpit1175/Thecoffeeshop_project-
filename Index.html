            <div class="text1"><span>Black Coffee</span><br><br>It is as simple as it gets with ground coffee beans steeped in hot water, served warm. And if you want to sound fancy, you can call black coffee by its proper name: cafe noir. Since it isnâ€™t doctored up with milk or sugar, the quality of coffee is especially important</div>

            <div class="text2"><span>Decaf Coffee</span><br><br> Beans naturally contain caffeine, but roasters can use several different processes to remove almost all of it. Decaf coffee is brewed with these decaffeinated beans.</div>

            <div class="text3"><span>Expresso Coffee</span><br><br> People know that a shot of espresso is stronger than the same amount of coffee, but what's the difference, exactly? There isn't anything inherently different about the beans themselves, but when beans are used to make espresso they're more finely ground, and they're brewed with a higher grounds-to-water ratio than what's used for coffee. </div>

            <div class="text4"><span>Latte Coffee</span><br><br> This classic drink is typically 1/3 espresso and 2/3 steamed milk, topped with a thin layer of foam, but coffee shops have come up with seemingly endless customizations. You can experiment with flavored syrups like vanilla and pumpkin spice or create a nondairy version by using oat milk. Skilled baristas often swirl the foam into latte art!
